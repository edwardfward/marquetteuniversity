# Lab Report
### Submitted By: Edward Ward (COSC 6560 701) Sunday, 19 February, 2023 

## Lab Assignment Week 5

## Purpose/Hypothesis
Gain experience with user management on a Linux operating system, define basic user access policy, and develop a basic understanding of SSH (Secure Shell).

## Equipment

For this lab, I used an Apple M1 (Mac OS Ventura 13.2 with 16GB RAM) as my workstation, Safari (version 16.3) to interact with the vSphere web client, and my workstationâ€™s Terminal application to SSH into the Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS Release 22.04 (64-bit) virtual machine (1 x vCPU, 1GB RAM, 16GB HD).

Here are some additional details on the VMware server:

## Procedure and Results
Before I create any new users or groups, I want to create a basic user policy for adding, removing, and managing user accounts for the class and define some password requirements to ensure users use strong, secure passwords. 

### User, Group, and Password Policy for `vm6540-4`

* All new students will be assigned to group `students` 
* Passwords  contain a minimum of 12 characters
* Passwords must contain a minimum of one (1) uppercase, one (1) lowercase, one (1) digit, and one (1) special character
* Passwords will be checked and verified against known `cracklib` dictionaries
* Passwords will not contain the user's username
* Passwords cannot contain more than three (3) repeating characters
* Passwords must be changed every 60 days
* Users cannot use any of their last (12) passwords
* New Passwords must have a mininum of four (4) diffrent characters than the previous password
* All new users will expire on the last day of the class
* All users will receive a 7-day notice prior to password expirations
* Password hashed using SHA512 with 15000 rounds

### Implement User, Group, and Password Policy

First step was to install `libpam-pwquality` and edit `/etc/security/pwquality.conf`
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```

Implement password change policy.
```bash
sudo vim /etc/login.defs

# Enable logging of successful logins
#
LOG_OK_LOGINS           yes

# Password aging controls:
#
#       PASS_MAX_DAYS   Maximum number of days a password may be used.
#       PASS_MIN_DAYS   Minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
#       PASS_WARN_AGE   Number of days warning given before a password expires.
#
PASS_MAX_DAYS   60
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
PASS_WARN_AGE   7

# Max number of login retries if password is bad. This will most likely be
# overriden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module has it's own built
# in of 3 retries. However, this is a safe fallback in case you are using
# an authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.
#
LOGIN_RETRIES           3

ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

#
# Only used if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
#
# Define the number of SHA rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password.
# But note also that it more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate
# users.
#
# If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000).
# The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.
# If only one of the MIN or MAX values is set, then this value will be used.
# If MIN > MAX, the highest value will be used.
#
SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 15000
SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 15000
```

Implement password policy.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Configuration for systemwide password quality limits
# Defaults:
#
# Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the
# old password.
difok = 4
#
# Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if
# credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_cracklib manual.)
# Cannot be set to lower value than 6.
minlen = 14
#
# The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0
# it is the minimum number of digits in the new password.
# dcredit = 0
#
# The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password.
# If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new
# password.
# ucredit = 0
#
# The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password.
# If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new
# password.
# lcredit = 0
#
# The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password.
# If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new
# password.
# ocredit = 0
#
# The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new
# password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others).
 minclass = 4
#
# The maximum number of allowed consecutive same characters in the new password.
# The check is disabled if the value is 0.
maxrepeat = 3
#
# The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the
# new password.
# The check is disabled if the value is 0.
# maxclassrepeat = 0
#
# Whether to check for the words from the passwd entry GECOS string of the user.
# The check is enabled if the value is not 0.
# gecoscheck = 0
#
# Whether to check for the words from the cracklib dictionary.
# The check is enabled if the value is not 0.
dictcheck = 1
#
# Whether to check if it contains the user name in some form.
# The check is enabled if the value is not 0.
usercheck = 1
#
# Length of substrings from the username to check for in the password
# The check is enabled if the value is greater than 0 and usercheck is enabled.
# usersubstr = 0
#
# Whether the check is enforced by the PAM module and possibly other
# applications.
# The new password is rejected if it fails the check and the value is not 0.
enforcing = 1
#
# Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default.
# dictpath =
#
# Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1.
retry = 3
#
# Enforces pwquality checks on the root user password.
# Enabled if the option is present.
enforce_for_root
#
# Skip testing the password quality for users that are not present in the
# /etc/passwd file.
# Enabled if the option is present.
# local_users_only
```

### Create `students` Group

Before adding users, I created the group defined in the policy above.

```bash
sudo groupadd -g 10000 students
```

### Check group was created

```bash
sudo tail /etc/group | grep students
students:x:10001:
```

### Create the following users

```bash
cat users.txt
golam
paullin
gu
abualrahi
bruno
velupillaimeikandan
mallett
voudrie
kong
sarumi
```

### Install password generator capable of meeting password requirements

```bash
sudo apt install pwgen
```

Generate secure passwords for each user in `users.txt` using the following script and `pwgen`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "-- createusers [line delimited file of user to create]"
  exit 0
fi

while read user; do
  echo "-----------------------"
  # generate password
  Password=$(pwgen -c -n -y -B -s  14 1)
  echo "User: $user             $Password" >> userpasswords.bin
  useradd -G students -M $user
  echo "User added...set passwd"
done < $1
```

```bash
sudo ./createusers.sh users.txt
```

Set passwords for each user and verify proper group.

```bash
sudo passwd golam
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully

id golam
uid=1002(golam) gid=1002(golam) groups=1002(golam),10001(students)

# remaining students removed for brevity
```

Logon in the user to demonstrate no home directory and ability to login. I had to change my `sshd` config to allow password logons, which I would normally NOT permit. I would secure all of my `sshd` daemons with public / private SSH keys vice passwords.  

I submitted this lab late so I was unable to notify each member of the class via email with their username and password so I demonstrated a logon from my computer using their username.

```bash
ssh golam@134.48.13.234
golam@134.48.13.234's password:

### Delete Student Users

Used the following script to remove all traces of the student users from the system.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "-- delusers [line delimited file of user to delete]"
  exit 0
fi

while read -r user; do
  echo "-----------------------"
  deluser --remove-home --remove-all-files "$user" "students"
  echo "$user deleted"
done < "$1"
```
Execute the script.
```bash
sudo ./delusers.sh users.txt
