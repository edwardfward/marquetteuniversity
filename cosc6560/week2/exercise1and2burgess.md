# Exercise 1&2 Chapter 1, Burgess

#### 1. Browse through this whole book from start to finish. Browsing information is as skill you will use a lot as as system administrator. Try to get an overall impression of what the book contains and how it is laid out.  

I did not find much value in browsing through the whole book to get an impression of what the book contains and how it is laid out. A quick glance of the book's Table of Contents provides a succint view of how the book is laid out and the topics covered. Skimming the book, it provides a new system administrator with a good understanding of what a "system" consists of and how "networked communities" run and are governed. The book continues to build upon fundamentals to provide a good grounding and overview of how to setup and customize system hardware, managing and taking care of users, maintaining and troubleshooting the system, changing and upgrading the system (and users), securing the system and protecting users, and how to observe and monitor the system and the types of behaviors to expect and prepare for in a systems administration capacity..

#### 2. List what you think are the most important tasks and responsibilities of a system adminstrator. You will have the opportunity to compare this with your impressions once we reach the end of the book.
